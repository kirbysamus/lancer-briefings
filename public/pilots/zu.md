## Trivia
- Antonio has several ponchos in his wardrobe he wears for different occasions: a rugged maroon one for sorties, a dark jade one for wildlife camo/exploration, and a soft brown one for casual wear.

- Has an NHP friend he's developing that he's named Doc Holiday, she likes the western cowgirl style of dress and together they play games while on autopilot, traveling from place to place. Space between the blink can get awfully lonely after all.

- He carries a bag full of BetaMixes of CMP to give to strangers in hopes of finding kindred spirits who appreciate his style of music.

- His Frame cockpit has been outfitted in such a way that allows him to use it as an abode while traveling and to avoid inn fees.

- He swears by gelato, specifically lemon flavored, and insists that if people tried it they would "get it."

- He comes from a large family of brothers and sisters who all wish he'd move back in and find a more sustainable line of work.
