Antonio’s story began in a relatively mundane manner amid the strife of the stars. A cosmopolitan, he was born on a city-ship, given birth by a pair of scientists, happily married and eager to show their family the infinite expanse of the stars. Astrologists and biologists, his parents made every preparation necessary for a safe and healthy birth, and made certain that Antonio grew into intellectuals the scientific pair would be proud of. Exploring theoretics and educational subject matter with an eager and curious mind, he eventually began to wonder about what lie beyond the stars. Shortly after adulthood, he gave into his wanderlust and set off to enlist, joining the Far-Field Team as his parents have. 

He's performed several short-term explorations of planets during his short stint as a Far-Fielder, but hasn't yet made a promising finding for a hospitable planet for the human species, which weighs on him. 

## Trivia:
-Antonio has several ponchos in his wardrobe he wears for different occasions: a rugged maroon one for sorties, a dark jade one for wildlife camo/exploration, and a soft brown one for casual wear.

-Has an NHP friend he's developing that he's named Doc Holiday, she likes the western cowgirl style of dress and together they play games while on autopilot, traveling from place to place. Space between the blink can get awfully lonely after all.

-He carries an older gen digital music player that's a keepsake of his father's; it's filled with various genres of music he and his family enjoy. "A soundtrack for life; each playlist, a mood." 

-Antonio loves a good gelato, and wishes to try a cinnamon-based "churro" flavored gelato one day, and learn the recipe if it's as great as he imagined, or improve it if not.

-Coming from a family of scientists, Antonio is often fascinated in the minutia of existence and often likes to theorize and deconstruct any technological marvel he can get his hands on.

-He likes to make friends and chat about anything and everything he can given the chance, regardless of circumstances, and despite his shyness. 

-Antonio calls his mech "Anzu" after a native shouted “An… Zu!” for him during his departure to another mission, likening his machine to a winged beast as it soared into the air. Before then, Antonio had no idea what to call his mobile Lancer suit. Someone even called him “Nameless” once, a moniker he carried for a few months.
