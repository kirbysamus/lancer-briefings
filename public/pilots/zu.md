## Trivia
- Antonio has several ponchos in his wardrobe he wears for different occasions: a rugged maroon one for sorties, a dark jade one for wildlife camo/exploration, and a soft brown one for casual wear.

- The name "Type - Worst Beat" was given to his Mech by himself as a cruel reminder of the industry's failings.

- He carries a bag full of BetaMixes of CMP to give to strangers in hopes of finding kindred spirits who appreciate his style of music.

- His Frame cockpit has been outfitted in such a way that allows him to use it as an abode while traveling and to avoid inn fees.

- He swears by gelato, specifically lemon flavored, and insists that if people tried it they would "get it."

- He comes from a large family of brothers and sisters who all wish he'd move back in and find a more sustainable line of work.
