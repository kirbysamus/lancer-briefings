Private Bio:

Experiment C1-770 was acquired as raw materials by the Smith-Shimano Corporation 204 standard years ago, formerly a stray child on the streets of a world outside of Union’s influence at the time. She was tested for aptitude and genetic adaptability, and pushed to the front of a genetic engineered scout project that was kept strictly off the record.

The experimentation and genetic modification continued for approximately 3 years, with testing and observation throughout. Once satisfactory results had been achieved, the regimen shifted to training in scouting and stealth, both inside and outside of a FRAME. At 5 years into this training, a Subjectivity Enhancement Suite was implanted inside of C1-770, to further enhance her proficiency as a scout.

Near the end of her training and testing, an intern in the labs was negligent in security procedures, leaving a door open on entry. Experiment C1-770 took the opportunity and escaped without being spotted, disappearing into an alley and fleeing. 

After a time, still in her training hardsuit and camo cloth that was her standard training equipment for the last decade, she made her way to a spaceport and climbed into a cargo container to hide and rest. Instead of cargo and quiet, she found a pilot bleeding through a sucking chest wound she was ill-equipped to treat. 

Instead of treatment, the pilot, callsign Rasputin, explained that he had been shot as the sole witness of a heinous crime, and dumped where he had been found to get rid of the evidence, but couldn’t identify the culprits. As if on cue, the cargo ship began taking off. In a panic, C1-770 began searching for any other living creatures on the ship, but she found none, only the rapidly dying Rasputin.

By the time she had settled down, Rasputin was on death’s doorstep. Between increasingly wet coughs, Rasputin shared stories of his life, his hopes and dreams, and his regrets. As his vision was already going, and he was growing increasingly cold, C1-770 knew he was not going to last much longer, and prepared for his passing.

It didn’t take long for the light to fade from his eyes. C1-770 wrapped the pilot’s body in some linens from the pilot’s cabin, which was discovered to be empty. For the following two years, C1-770 attempted to work out where the cargo ship was headed, and how to stop it safely. 

The NHP was unresponsive, the reported speed was several orders of magnitude faster than is allowed, seeing approximately 0.99996c, and the estimated arrival at the selected system was roughly two years away. For the remainder of her time on the cargo ship, she continued to attempt to either disconnect or disable the NHP to no avail.

She placed the body of Rasputin in the pilot’s cold-sleep bed to keep it from decomposing over the following two years, and began researching political and system news using the ship’s omninet as much as possible between daily exercises and routine meals.

Two years later, the cargo ship drops to a non-relativistic speed in a Union controlled system and is flagged down by passing system security and guided to a landing zone on a nearby planet. Upon exiting the ship, C1 is taken to processing and explains why she was on a ship that had been missing for roughly 200 years, how she found a dying pilot in the cargo hold, and no pilot onboard when the ship took off on its own.

She reported the now-200-year-out-of-date SSC genetic super-soldier program that used children as raw materials, but has no idea whether it’s still running or not. During processing and registration, she is given a piloting exam and tests out at Lancer level, due to the super-soldier training and genetic modifications.

C1 then registered as a pilot with Union for a Farfield Team under the callsign Rasputin, with her name given as the only thing she was ever called, her test subject designation, C1-770. On the way to her first far-field team assignment via blink travel, a distress beacon is discovered nearby in the Ardennes-3 system and she is compelled to respond by law.
