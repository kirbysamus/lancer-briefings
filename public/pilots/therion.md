Alma Voidbrooke was born and raised on Sparr, where she was instilled with her people's cultural values as well as received most of her combat training. In her early adulthood she left her planet to seek glory and triumph worthy to have tattooed upon her person, as many traditional Sparri people do. Heeding the advice of her elders, she decided to start with something on the easier side to become accustomed to space travel and working in organized units before taking on anything grand. She signed up to become a security officer, seeing it as a means to further her training and obtain experience, as well as have opportunities to interact with people of other cultures.

During her time as a security officer, she had several difficulties related to how she chose to handle situations, often using more force than necessary or causing small amounts of property damage during the capture of criminals and suspects, however even despite this, she has not yet killed anyone by accident due to a combination of restraint and her training. While she regards this period of her life as relatively boring, it did lead her to encountering people who would change her views on Union and give her new goals in life.

Aboard a space-station, Alma met a group of Ungratefuls, or perhaps just Ungrateful sympathizers, who were rallying a crowd and spreading word of injustice and oppression. After listening to what they had to say, or rather shout about, she looked into their cause on the Omninet and found herself appalled at what the people of the Dawnline Shore were having to suffer through. And so she decided to don the sky-blue of their cause, often as a scarf, or patches and paint on her equipment. 

Sympathizing with the Ungratefuls' plights from Free Sanjak to the various planets engulfed in war within the Dawnline Shore, Alma requested to be transferred The Long Rim so she could be closer to where people needed help while also being near enough that she could begin requesting to become part of a detachment of Union officers sent to help the people living within the Dawnline Shore. There, she believed she could make a difference that could matter, make peoples lives better, and either become a hero or die like one. 

Her superior officers were glad to approve her transfer to The Long Rim, as her violent tendencies would be put to better use there. However, they already had her scheduled for a couple of jobs seeing freighter ships to their destinations, so her transfer would have to wait for a short time. Unfortunately, or perhaps even fortunately for Alma, she would find herself called to action by a distress beacon, and would need to intervene in a situation involving a colony being attacked by raiders on a planet she had barely heard of. Hercynia.
