Born as the youngest daughter of a moderately wealthy core-world merchant family, Allie was promised largely nothing as an inheritance. Instead, her parents paid for an academy education and her life away from home. For just over a decade, she spent nearly every waking moment in training simulations and tactics training on an academic level, with nearly perfect marks in every course and no social life.

Over the course of many simulated battles in the academy training grounds, she earned the nickname of Rasputin for her seeming inability to stay down, regardless of the damage taken.

Just before her 22nd birthday, she graduated in the top percent of her class, and immediately signed on with Union for a Farfield Team assignment, mostly against the wishes of her family, who cut off financial support. On her way to her first posting with a farfield team, the ship carrying her picks up a distress beacon from the Ardennes-3 system, and she is obligated to investigate.
