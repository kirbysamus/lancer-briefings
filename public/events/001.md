>//: Distress Call received 2 Standard Months ago from EVERGREEN, a colony on the planet HERCYNIA in the ATLAS line, seeking aid against unidentified aggressors.

>//: EVERGREEN is under the administration of LANDMARK COLONIAL, a minor subsidary corporation of SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO. First objective is to make contact with local LC Representative and integrate into local hierarchy.

>//: Situation on-ground is to be treated with utmost care. Recent investigation suggests possibility of extant human populations on HERCYNIA upreported by LC. Ground Team is advised not to reveal these suspicions to LC Personnel unless deemed necessary.

>//: Further research has yielded little information about HERCYNIA'S history prior to founding of EVERGREEN. Data suggests HERCYNIA was once subject to widespread and catastrophic military action by SECCOMM, though records lack meaningful detail. Recent scans show large irradiated zones on planetary surface, as well as decayed and encrypted communications broadcasting on-loop. Ground Team should expect to encounter remnants of SECCOMM presence: unexploded ordinance, waste radiation, and potentially even derelict military installations.

>//: HERCYNIA planetary and Blink Gate information to follow.
