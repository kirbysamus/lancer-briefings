# Mission // #004a
## Last Castle

Brava Hadura outlines the situation: At best, the colony has abandoned the refugees outside the walls. At worst, it views them not simply as a liability, but as an active and growing threat to security. She is unable to act directly in her capacity as militia commander, but with the broad emergency powers granted to the PCs by Patience and their status as freelancers, they can certainly assist. She asks the PCs to aid the refugees in whatever way they can. In return, she promises to requisition licenses and resources for them, along with anything else she can slide under the table.

If they ask around the camp, the PCs find out about three opportunities to offer aid. They have time to complete two out of the three tasks.

# Goals
- Aid the refugee camp outside of Evergreen in any ways possible.

# Stakes
- Without aid or anyone to advocate for them, the refugees will be slaughtered or captured when the Machine arrives at the city. In addition, unless the PCs intervene, many of the refugees will die needlessly in front of their eyes in BEAT 16A.5: A STAIN YOU CANâ€™T WASH OUT.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
