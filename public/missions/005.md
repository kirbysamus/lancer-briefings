# Mission // #005
## Split-Knuckle Haymaker

This is the final mission in Act 1 of No Room For A Wallflower. After its completion, the narrative of this act effectively ends.

There are two ways the PCs can approach this mission. At any time, they can choose to simply attack the Governor’s Farm directly, skipping right to BEAT 23: SPLIT-KNUCKLE HAYMAKER (p. 162). Going right here without preparation or dealing with the Cassander will be extremely difficult, which should be made very clear to both the players and their characters.

The other is to prepare by getting the HUC to aid Evergreen (if they haven’t already), freeing Contingency White from prison, and disabling the Cassander. Each of these steps has its own beats; each one that is completed (in any order) will make BEAT 23 easier by removing encounters.

# Goals
- Defeat Beggar One.

# Stakes
- If this mission fails, Evergreen will remain occupied and the extermination of the local population will begin.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
