# Mission // #004b
## Rallying Cry

Dthall is brief and straightforward: she doesn’t believe that Hivehome or Evergreen will survive alone. Now that she’s certain Evergreen isn’t on the side of the Machine and all the blood has been shed over a misunderstanding, she’s more convinced than ever that uniting the disparate communities and making amends is the only possible way to victory.

In a few days, the leaders of the HUC are going to have a meeting to decide how to proceed with the war against the Machine. The PCs will be present for this meeting as representatives of Evergreen.

In the meantime, they have opportunities to make inroads with the various factions of Hivehome’s leadership (in BEAT 16B.3: WAYWARD SONS AND DAUGHTERS and BEAT 16B.4: TERROR’S FAVOR). Since there is limited time, they will only be able to aid one group (assisting either Dthall Ordo or Terror, an Egregorian commander). Their decision will affect the events of BEAT 16B.5: LAST CALL IN EGREGORE CROSS. The PCs could skip both beats and simply wait for their audience but make clear that doing so means they will have little clout at the meeting and will also miss out on any rewards from Dthall and Terror.

# Goals
- Convince the city-states of the HUC to rally under one banner, come to the aid of Evergreen, and continue the war against the Machine.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, Evergreen’s reactors will be destroyed, forcing the colony to use backup power, demolishing its defenses and its ability to function.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
